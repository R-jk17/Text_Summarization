# Text Summarization

Text summarization is particularly useful when when need to creat shorter version of a longer text without leaving out the most useful information.
Generally there are two ways of performing text summarization:
1) ## Extractive Summarization:
   It involves selecting and combining the most important sentences
   and phrases from the original text.
2) ## Abstractive summarization:
   It involves generating new sentences that capture the essence of the original text.


In this repo, i have demonstrated a technique for performing extractive summarization using 't5-small' model from HuggingFace Transformers.
For someone who is just learning about NLP, this repo can help them how to perform summarization on a text data.
Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your needs!
