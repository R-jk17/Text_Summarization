This code is a Python script that uses the LangChain library to summarize a PDF document. It imports several modules from the LangChain library, including load_summarize_chain, PyPDFLoader, and HuggingFaceHub. It defines a function called summarize_pdf that takes as input the file path of a PDF document and returns a summary of the document. The function first loads the PDF document using the PyPDFLoader module, then uses the load_summarize_chain function to create a summarization chain based on a pre-trained model from Hugging Face. Finally, the function uses the summarization chain to generate a summary of the input document and returns it.
